The libbpf directory is regularly synced with https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf.
All the file under that repo will be copied into libbpf directory except .git directory.

If you have any change in libbpf/ directory, please upstream to linux first
as libbpf repo is a mirror of linux/tools/lib/bpf directory.

libbpf should be periodically updated so that bcc can access latest linux bpf/btf
uapi headers and other newly added functionalities. The following are the necessary
steps to sync libbpf:
   1. copy https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf repo files into libbpf directory
      except .git file.
   2. sync compat/linux/virtual_bpf.h with libbpf/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h
      as virtual_bpf.h has an extra string wrapper for bpf.h.
   3. if new bpf.h has new helpers, add corresponding helper func define
      in bcc:src/cc/export/helpers.h and helper entry for error reporting
      in bcc:src/cc/libbpf.c.
   4. if new bpf.h has new map types, program types, update bcc:introspection/bps.c
      for these new map/program types.
